This article is
part of an Earth
Month series
exploring
environmental
issues, climate
initiatives and
community
stakeholders
throughout
Providence and
Rhode Island.

In the past two
years, the
Driving Rhode
Island to Vehicle
Electrification
project, has
granted over $3
million in rebates
to individuals
and businesses
who purchase
electric vehicles.

Launched in July
2022, DRIVE EV
is part of a wider
effort to phase
out the sale of
all gas-powered
vehicles by
2035, according
to a May 2023
press release
communicated
by Gov. Dan
McKee.

The project is
funded and
administered
jointly with the
Rhode Island
Office of Energy
Resources and
the Rhode Island
Infrastructure
Bank. The two
agencies first
partnered in
2015 on the
Efficient
Buildings Fund
to expand
renewable
energy
production in the
state, according

annual
conference on
March 9,
exploring the
theme “Mirage”
in an event
featuring five
speakers and an

Speakers
delivered
presentations on
topics ranging
from the
importance of
liberation
through
education to the
possibility of
space tourism.
“Mirage
represents the
things that aren’t

TEDxBrownU.

Haleema Aslam
’25 delivered the
first talk of the
conference,
titled “Liberation
Through
Education.”
Aslam
highlighted the
importance of
education as she
discussed her
journey from 15-
year-old child
bride to Brown
student.

Despite growing
up in a tribe
where girls
rarely attended
school, Aslam
learned to read
and write,
completing her
high school
education
against her
mother’s wishes.
This
commitment to
education

On March 19,
the RI American
Cancer Society
Cancer Action
Network,
commonly
abbreviated as
ACS CAN, held
a virtual event
titled “Beyond
the Rainbow:
Addressing
Cancer
Disparities in
LGBTQIA+
Communities.”
Held over Zoom,
the event
discussed the
disproportionate
impact of cancer
on LGBTQ+
people and
possible policy
solutions.

Moderated by
Bob Gordon, a
longtime ACS
CAN volunteer
from California,
the discussion
attracted over
100 attendees.
Its aim was to
emphasize “the
vital role of
vibrant and
diverse voices
and raising
awareness
about the
challenges
facing
(LGBTQ+)
communities” as
a part of the
22nd National
LGBTQ+ Health
Awareness
Week, according
to Gordon.

“Many of us face
barriers to care,
such as fear of
discrimination
from providers
— in fact, one-
third of LGBTQ+
people report
that their health
care provider
never mentioned
cancer
screening to
them,” Gordon
explained.

It's never easy
to start a project
from scratch but
it's even more
challenging
when you have
an unfortunate
history of
unsuccessful
projects.

One crypto
influencer who
has suffered the
wrath of the
community
recently is Irene
Zhao, whose
Jupiter-collab
memecoin
project,
Asianmom, has
been branded a
scam.

According to
Jupiter, the
memecoin will
follow a new
framework
promoting the
principles of
certainty,
alignment, and
transparency in
response to the
current meta of
bot sniping,
opaque dev
allocation, and Irene Zhao's

dumps. Initial     Crypto Scandal

term incentives. Comeback?
Immediately
after the
announcement
of the Asianmom
project, several
users expressed
their
dissatisfaction.
Famed Crypto
Twitter user
ZachXBT,
renowned for
calling out
scams in the
crypto space,
was one of the
biggest names
to call Zhao out.

He alleged that
Zhao did a
secret deal with
DWF labs, as
the founder of
SO-COL (SIMP),
of which the
terms were not
disclosed and
the community
had zero
knowledge,
essentially
"rugging" all the
early investors.

A screenshot
posted by
ZachXBT
revealed that
one investor was
not pleased with
the DWF deal,
claiming that it
would drive
SIMP to almost
zero, making it
hard to onboard
creators.
According to
ZachXBT, there
were tons of
messages from
angry investors
from the chats
when Zhao was
posting on X
Others in the
community were
also quick to
point out that
besides SOCOL,
Zhao was also a
Chief Marketing
Officer for
Konomic
Network
(KONO). Both
projects
experience a
substantial drop
in prices, with
SIMP down
98.9% and
KONO down
99.9%.
                    Mother Rugger
Firstly, what is
SOCOL?
According to
their whitepaper,
SOCOL is
focused on
making NFTs
accessible and
affordable for
everyone, as
well as a web3
social app for
creators and
communities.

SOCOL seeks to
disrupt the
creator economy
by being the all-
in-one platform
where creators
can unite their
communities and
give their
audiences a
stake in the
community
through utility-
based NFTs.

"Fans that are
already
spending a lot of
time and money
simping for
creators," Zhao
explained to
Blockhead back
in 2022. "By
holding an NFT
of the creator,
fans can tell
people that
they’re a
superfan. You
can say you
were there for
the partnerships
and proposals;
it’s proof you’re a
superfan. It’s
also much easier
for celebrities to
interact with the
fans!”

Riding on this
mission, SOCOL
managed to
raise total
funding of $6.3
million, with
May's 2022
round valuing
the project at
$100 million. As
per the
tokenomics, the
native token for
SOCOL, SIMP
acts as a
governance
token, allowing
holders to vote
on governance
proposals.
Besides staking
for rewards,
holders of SIMP
can also
participate in
marketing
campaigns to
earn airdrops of
SIMP or other
tokens.

Listed on Kucoin
in January 2023,
the total supply
for SIMP was set
at 1,000,000,000
with an initial
circulating
supply of
49,000,000
which represents
4.9% of the total
supply available
upon the Token
Generation
Event (TGE).
With a listing
price of $0.03,
this represents a
market
capitalization of
$1.47 million and
a Fully Diluted
Valuation (FDV)
of $30 million.

Investors are
subjected to
vesting over 15
months after the
initial 3-month
cliff while the
teams' token is
vested over 24
months after a
12-month cliff
period. Given
the vesting
schedule, it is
hard to argue
that the project
was designed to
rug or scam
investors from
the start as
some might
have suggested
on Twitter.
However, it is
important to note
the low
circulating float
and the
valuation at
which the project
was
launched.SIMP
traded to the
upside
immediately
after listing,
peaking at
$0.1090 before
eventually
trading below
the listing price
after a few
months. Despite
having a staking
feature, there
were no
additional buyers
for SIMP. By the
time the 3-month
cliff had ended,
prices had
already dropped
around 70%
below the listing Controversy
price.             #1: SOCOL
Zhao clarified
the situation on
X, stating that
she should have
been more
transparent
about the difficult
situation she
was facing and
should have
sought existing
investors'
opinions before
agreeing to new
deals.

However, at that
time, she said
she truly
believed that
accepting
funding from
DWF was the
only solution to
save the project
and it was never
her intention to
rug or scam
anyone. Zhao
further added
that after the
price surge
when the deal
with DWF was
announced, they
ended up
pausing the
investment deal
after early
investors took
issue with the
deal. Perhaps
this has
something to do
with DWF selling
the tokens
before the 1-year
vesting.

As a founder,
she takes full
responsibility for
her failure to
build the right
team and to find     Irene's
product-market       Response to

Zhao served as

and ecosystem
partnerships.
KONO has seen
prices fall from
$4.63 to
$0.006562 at the
time of writing,
with some in the
community
associating the
blame to her.
"The crypto
industry has
always treated
these scammers
so leniently, is it
just because
she's better
looking? No one
ever seems to
remember how
many people
she scammed
while working       Controversy

one disgruntled Network
X user.             (KONO)
Zhao clarified
that she had no
involvement in
the
development,
operations, or
management in
any way, adding
that she should
have done a
better job in
explaining her
role in the
project.

"I should have
been a lot more
conscious about
my past projects.
For example -
explaining my
role in Konomi
better, since a lot
of them bought
because of my Irene's
presence" said Response to

A developer
launched a
meme coin on
memecoin site

months ago
using ticket
IRENE, causing
users to think
that the token
was related to
her. IRENE's
price has fallen
more than 50%
over its brief
lifespan thus far.
However, as
memecoins by
nature are
speculative, akin
to gambling,
users should
always abide by
"DYOR" before
committing to it.
A quick search
would have
revealed that it
was not the real
Irene behind the
token, users
blaming her for
the loss because
they did not do Controversy
any research do #3: Unoffcial
not seem to be Memecoin
fair towards her. (IRENE)
"I didn’t address
a lot of the
meme coins that
launched based
on my brand nor
clarify that I
wasn’t involved
in them -
causing a lot of
people to buy
them
mistakenly,"
Zhao told
Blockhead.
"What I want to
do is to create a
new meme coin
meta, to invest
my time, effort
and energy into
cultivating real
relationships and
community and
that's why I
decided to work Irene's
with Jupiter      Response to
because we        Controversy
have aligned      #3: Unofficial
vision," she      meme coin
added.            (IRENE)
In an industry
that is already
known for
scammers,
transparency is
of utmost
importance,
especially for
founders. Given
the nature of
blockchain, most
transactions can
be eventually
traced anyway
and hence it is
even more
crucial for
founders to be
transparent
regarding their
past.

Influencers
should also be
more explicit
about their role
in any project
they associate
with, especially if
they have no
actual
involvement in
the operation or
management of
the project as is
the case with
Zhao for the
KONO Network.
Given their huge
reach and
following, some
followers may
simply buy the
tokens due to
the influencer's
association.

According to
Zhao, some
investors in
SOCOL initiated
the idea of
launching a
memecoin in
March this year.
Under the new
framework by
Jupiter, will it be
enough to
escape the fate
of the countless
celebrity meme
coins that have
lost most of their
value? Zhao
revealed to
Blockhead that
she is committed
to the Asiamum
project and
wants to do it
the right way.

"The fact that I
have been the
target of many
rug coins and
also my own
experiences
have taught me
the importance
of transparency
and community
trust," she said.

"That’s why I’m
committed to do
this project the
right way. I’m
also very good at
creating
constant
engagement and
rallying a
community from
previous
experiences, I
think that’s what
a meme project
needs the most."

Ultimately, just
because the
project did not
perform well
does not
constitute a
scam. Despite
the performance
of SIMP, it is not
fair to compare a
utility or
governance
token against a
meme-coin.
Memecoins are
of a different
category - they
are meant to
have no utility
and are purely
attention-
seeking
instruments.
Zhao has
demonstrated
her ability to
garner attention
and engagement Comeback
given her past. Challenge
Irene Zhao’s
name and
reputation are
often tarnished
with terms such
as “simp” and
“cash grab.”
Unflattering at
best and ruinous
at worst, such
terms have
earned her the
spotlight for all
the wrong
reasons, but
beneath her
glamorous
Instagram posts
and meme-
inspired NFTs, is
a sharp,
entrepreneurial
and ambitious
woman.

At a time when
some of the
biggest names in
crypto have
fallen from grace
amid crypto
winter, Irene
Zhao has
retained a
relatively quiet
profile compared
to earlier this
year. But, make
no mistake, the
Singaporean-
based influencer
is craftily
navigating        In Defence of

Zhao’s
decentralized
autonomous
organization
(DAO), Irene
DAO, might
already be
yesterday’s
news, but five
months on, the
web3 project has
proven its worth.
Explaining to
Blockhead, Zhao
said, “We
created 117
Irene DAO
NFTs, and then
gave them all
away for free.
We didn’t make
any money from
it; any money we
made from the
royalties went to
the Irene DAO
treasury and
charity.”

Despite what
was previously
perceived as a
“cash grab”, the
DAO NFTs may
have seen
US$7.5 million in
trading volume,
but the founders
pocketed none
of it. “It was
more of an
experiment and
proof of concept
for SoCol,” Zhao
tells us.

SoCol is a web3
creators’
platform backed
by the likes of
Animoca,
DeFiance
Capital and even
3AC (don’t
worry, 3AC’s
seed funding
was through
tokens). Irene
DAO is parked
under SoCol and
is being used to
demonstrate the
power of creator
platforms.
Holders of Irene
DAO NFTs
instantly become
members of
Irene DAO and
are able to vote
on initiatives and
propose
partnerships.
“The members
actually took it
upon themselves
to initiate work.
The amazing
thing is, you just
need to tell the
leader what you
want to do –
whether it’s
supporting
women, children,
or charities –
and the
members will do
the work as a
community,”
Zhao explained.

I have two
personas on the
two social media
platforms
SoCol and Zhao
believe the
model is
applicable to
celebrities such
as Kpop stars
who have “fans
that are already
spending a lot of
time and money
simping for
creators. By
holding an NFT
of the creator,
fans can tell
people that
they’re a
superfan. You
can say you
were there for
the partnerships
and proposals;
it’s proof you’re a
superfan. It’s
also much easier
for celebrities to
interact with the
fans!” For all
those looking to
start their own
DAO, Zhao
offers a heads-
up. “Getting
responsible
leaders is a
challenge,” she
said. “They’re
publicly elected
but they can also
be not capable
enough. They
keep on coming
up with new
ideas but there’s
no execution.”

To overcome it,
Zhao said
releasing
announcements
through the DAO
would help to
encourage the Damn Good
leaders to step DAO
up.
Crypto winter
has caused a
countless
number of
projects (and
even companies
to fold), but
Zhao’s
prospects
remain strong.

“Yes, Ethereum
dropped a lot so
it affected our
treasury but it’s
OK because
we’re tightening
costs,” she says.
“It’s really fine
for us.”

In terms of
encouraging
influencers to
jump from web2
to web3, Zhao
still remains
confident. “The
reason most
people fail is
because they
don’t have utility.
Look at Chris
Brown, only
around 30 of his
10,000 NFT
collection sold.
You can’t just
have a profile
picture of
yourself, you
need to define
clearly what the
NFT does so
you can have
more people
buying it.” Zhao
also believes in
the strength of
the creator
economy to
overcome crypto
winter and FUD.
“Web3 people
buy NFTs for
investments but
for web2 people,
it’s not much
about the
investment. For
the creator
economy,
people just want
to support the
creators and
want to
contribute to
their careers so
they come up
with new and
much better
work. The
incentive is very
different.”

“I really don’t
think crypto
winter is
affecting this
area much –
those supporting Surviving
creators in web2 Crypto Winter
will also do so in & FUD
web3.”
FUD and crypto
winter are not
diminishing
Zhao’s outlook
on the potential
of web3 either.
“Compared to
web2, web3
allows you to
manage your
community like
never before.
With OnlyFans
and Twitch, the
interaction is
only one way:
fans pay money
to support you.
But the thing is,
they don’t get
any monetary
returns except
exclusive
content. If you
have NFT
ownership, you
can potentially
make money by
selling it on the
secondary
market.” “As
more people
hold the NFTs,
the value of the
NFT will
increase and
fans will have a
way to make
money. This can
never happen in
web2.”

Zhao believes
that moving
forward, creators
are still
incentivised to
adopt web3
irrespective of
market turmoil.
“It revolutionizes
how creators
interact with fans
and creators can
make more
content out of
web3 because
with SoCol, your
social media
content can
become NFTs.
For example,
your post in
2016 has no
value in web2
but if you turn it
into an NFT,
people who want
to hold a piece of
your memories Web2 vs.
can buy it.”       Web3
Before jumping
into web3, Zhao
had already
amassed a
strong following
on Instagram.
With many non-
believers of
web3 lurking in
web2 social
media, Zhao has
strategically
realigned her
online presence
to tailor to her
fans.

“Most of my
followers are
guys,” Zhao
acknowledged,
“And guys are
generally more
interested web3
technology.
There was a
smooth
transition from
Instagram to
Twitter for those
who are more
interested in the
technical stuff.”

“I portray a
different image
on Instagram
compared to
Twitter. On
Instagram I
rarely talk about
crypto stuff
because most of
my fans follow
me for lifestyle,
fitness,
happiness and
personal stuff.
They’re really
not interested in
crypto, so I tend
not to talk about
it.” “For those
who are
interested in
crypto, they can
follow me on
Twitter. I have
two personas on
the two different
social media
platforms.
People can
choose which
one they like
more.”. Despite
Zhao’s largely
male following,
female creators
are also inspired
by her work.
“Female creators
want to create
their own DAOs.
When they saw
Irene DAO, they
wanted to try
their own NFT
stuff and
mobilize their fan
community.
Right now, their
only way to
make money on
something like
OnlyFans is
through
advertisements
or sponsorships,
and most of
them don’t really
want to do that.”

“After seeing
Irene DAO they
realised there’s a
better way to
make money just
by doing what
they’re good at
and producing
content. The
DAO has
incentivised a lot
of female
creators to get
into the web3      A Different
space and know Irene for a
more about         Different
what’s going on.”Crowd
For better or
worse, Zhao
made headlines
for being a cash
grab. “Everyone
thought we
made $8 million
on Irene DAO
but the truth is
that it’s just
transaction
volume. The
royalties were
only about
$300k-400k at
that time. Now
Ethereum has
dropped a lot
too.”

She also wants
people to know
that the DAO’s
initiative was not
money focused.
“It’s not really
about the
money. We want
to do something
to change how
the creator
economy works.
For me, there
are a lot of ways
to make money
– I could just
launch another
NFT selling at
0.2 ETH, and
could make a
few million
easily. But we
chose to make a
product instead;
it’s the hardest
thing to do.
There are many
easy ways to
make money in
the web3 world
but building a
product people
use is the
hardest.”


To overcome
these
misconceptions,
Zhao believes
the proof must
be in the
pudding. “After
we launch the
product, people
are going to see
that we’re really
doing something
right, it’s not just
NFTs. Right
now, people
won’t spend the
time to find out
what SoCol is
about. All they
know is Irene
DAO because
there’s too much
(wrong) media
coverage.”

“So I think once
we have the
product ready,
we can onboard
some creators
and actually
create NFTs for
them, and then
they have good
engagement
with the fans and
form really great
community on
SoCol, it’ll
change people’s
minds.”             Overcoming
                    Misconceptions
Although Zhao
isn’t scared of
the market
downturn, she
isn’t oblivious to
it. “I think crypto
winter is going to
be here for at
least a year,”
she said bleakly.
However, she’s
quick to see the
silver lining in
the clouds. “The
good thing is
that all the bad
projects are
going to die
because they
don’t really have
the correct
market fit. If they
spend money
like crazy, they
don’t have
enough runway
to sustain that
kind of cost."
“It’s a good thing
for all the
valuable and
legit projects
because right
now, there’s
much less noise.
If it’s a bull
market,
everyone is
raising money
like crazy and
nobody is
focused on
doing the
project.” Taking
this approach to
her work, Zhao
says crypto
winter has given
them the
opportunity to
throw all their
efforts into their
product. “So
right now for
SoCol, we want
to launch a really
good product
with a really nice
UIUX that’s
attractive for
web2 users so
they can use the
platform
seamlessly,” she
said.

“Crypto winter
has also forced
us to tighten our
team and be
much more
efficient. We let
go some of the
not-so hard
working ones,”
Zhao said. “It’s a
good thing that
we can’t raise
money as easily
as in a bull
market because
we are left with a
much more
efficient team
and everybody’s
boded together.”
                     Zhao’s Outlook
Three Brown
students were
named Barry
Goldwater
Scholars, an
award intended
to support
college
sophomores and
juniors with
promising
futures as
researchers in
the sciences,
mathematics
and engineering.
Awardees
receive a
scholarship of
$7,500 per year.

This year, 438
winners were
chosen to
receive the
award among a
pool of over
5,000 applicants,
according to the
Goldwater
Scholarship’s
website.

The Herald
spoke with the
three Brown
awardees about
their work —
ranging from
prosthetic
development to
cancer
therapeutics —
as well as
reactions to
winning the
scholarship.

Elizabeth
Polydefkis ’25: A
bioengineer
working towards
a more
accessible world
As a young
child, Elizabeth
Polydefkis ’25
knew she
wanted to be an
engineer while
watching her
father adapt to
life with a
progressive
neurological
condition.

“Seeing the
creative
adaptations my
father has made
to his laboratory
instruments,
gardening tools
and sports
equipment so
that he could
work and enjoy
his passions was
a huge reason
why I wanted to
become an
engineer in the
first place,”
Polydefkis told
The Herald.

Polydefkis grew
up watching her
father struggle
with devices
designed without
adequate input
from customers.
Now, Polydefkis
studies
biomedical
engineering in
hopes of
“enhancing
accessibility and
independence
for individuals
with physical
disabilities.”

Her research
interests led her
to work in Johns
Hopkins
University’s
Haptics and
Medical
Robotics
Laboratory over
the summer of
2023. Her work
focused on
improving 3D-
printed upper
limb prosthetics
by adding haptic
feedback
systems, which
allow users to
decide the
needed amount
of force to
perform a certain
action.

“Persons without
tactile sensation
or impaired
tactile sensation
lack the dexterity
required to
complete daily
activities
efficiently and
accurately,”
Polydefkis
explained. “The
mental energy
expended using
a prosthesis is
exhausting for
limb-absent
individuals and
reduces
functionality.”

To address this
issue, she
investigated
“accurate
mapping of
haptic feedback”
for 3D-printed
prosthetics.

Polydefkis
credited the
Brown
community with
fostering her
love for
research.

“At Brown, I am
surrounded by
people
conducting
amazing
research on top
of their
extracurriculars
and academic
commitments, so
I genuinely was
not expecting to
win when I
applied,” she
said.

Clara Tandar
’25: A future
physician-
scientist
engineering
better cancer
therapeutics

As a
bioengineering
and International
and Public
Affairs double
concentrator,
Clara Tandar ’25
hopes not only
to develop new
therapeutics but
also to translate
that research
into effective
policy action.

 “I ultimately
want to be a
physician-
scientist and
focus a lot on
the therapeutic
and patient side
of things,”
Tandar told The
Herald. “But that
doesn’t exist in a
vacuum. I want
to be able to
communicate my
work to not only
experts in the
field but also a
general
audience as
well.”

For Tandar,
winning the
Goldwater was
an important
affirmation of the
path she had
chosen to take.

“It’s a nice
reminder that
what I’m doing
can have an
impact on
patients
someday,” she
said. “But within
the grand
scheme of
things, it just
inspires me to
keep pursuing a
broad
interdisciplinary
approach.”

Tandar credited
Brown’s
environment for
encouraging her
to take a wide
variety of
classes, ranging
from sociology
to a history
capstone. “I truly
think that I have
incorporated all
of those classes
into how I
approach my
research
interests, even if Three Brown
it’s not so        students win
directly obvious prestigious
or related,” she Goldwater
said.              scholarship
Decentralized
crypto
aggregator
Jupiter has
found itself in the
middle of
controversy after
announcing a
collaboration
with an exposed
influencer.

Solana
decentralized
exchange
aggregator
Jupiter has
sparked a
furious outrage
in the crypto
community
following its
announcement
of a collaboration
with Irene Zhao,
a Singaporean
influencer
previously
implicated in
multiple crypto-
related dubious
activities.

In an X
announcement
on Jul. 22, the
anonymous
founder of
Jupiter, known
as @weremeow,
unveiled the
collaboration
aimed at
improving the
“meme coin
meta” and giving
“degens an on-
chain mom to
care for them
when they are
sad.” With the
initiative, the
Jupiter founder
said the trading
platform wants
to address
“major problems”
plaguing the
current meme
coin launch
environment,
such as “fake      Solana-based
wide distribution, Jupiter sparks
sniping,” and      controversy for
“lying             collaborating
influencers.”      with Irene Zhao
Singapore —
Singapore-
based Chinese
influencer and
Instagram model
Yuqing Irene
Zhao listed her
non-fungible
token’s (NFT),
garnering
purchases from
prominent
individuals like
Galaxy Digital
CEO Mike
Novogratz and
giving her
millions within
days.

An NFT is
unique digital
data such as a
drawing, Tweet,
meme, music, or
game character
that can’t be
replaced with
something else.
The owner of an
NFT can then
trade or sell the
unit of data on
digital markets.


More people are
jumping into the
NFT
marketplace,
raking in millions
for lucky sellers.

NFTs are
purchased,
traded and sold
through
cryptocurrency,
mostly
Ethereum,
before
withdrawing in
real currency.
For Zhao, it’s her
IreneDAO
collection
currently listed
on Opensea, a
peer-to-peer
marketplace for
NFTs, rare
digital items and
crypto
collectables.

Her listing
description on
Opensea notes,
“IreneDAO is a

grassroots
movement
aimed at
disrupting the
creator
economy.
IreneDAO is for
the people, by
the people. Our
core values are:
Sincerity,
Integrity,
Meaning, and
Purpose.”
Zhao’s collection
consists of over
a thousand
items,
showcasing
images of her
and meme slang
phrases such as
“Damp It,” “Up
Only,” “Simp” or
“Wen Moon.” In
total, Zhao’s
collection
already has a
trading volume
of 2,300
Ethereum, which
is equivalent to
approximately
S$7.5 million.

Zhao distributed
her crypto
memes with a
free mint,
allowing digital
art to become a
part of the
Ethereum
blockchain. It is
then
unchangeable
and tamper-
proof, much like
how metal coins
are minted
before being
added into
circulation.

Reports noted
that Zhao’s
endeavours
began with her
selling the
images as a
sticker pack on NFT earnings
Telegram. A fan of S$7.5 million
then advised her in 10 days for
to turn the       S’pore-based
collection into influencer Irene

over $5.5 million
within 10 days of
launch. It also
attracted
celebrities such
as Logan Paul
who bought in
for more than
$250k, as well
as billionaire

This crazy
success marked
the beginning of

much more.         Story
Irene Zhao is a
Singapore-
based Instagram
model and a
crypto
influencer. She
got into crypto in
early 2022 when
her NFT
collection,
IreneDAO, had a
successful
launch with over
$5.5 million
trading volume,
according to
data from
OpenSea.
IreneDAO NFTs
drew the
attention of
YouTuber Logan
Paul, who
bought around
20 pieces for
around
$270,000.
From the launch
of IreneDAO, the
influencer has
been active in
the crypto
industry,
initiating several
projects.
However, those
projects either
didn’t have long-
term success or
Irene left them
soon after
launching.

The IreneDAO
NFT collection
that made Irene
popular serves
as access
tickets to the
decentralized
community
where people
can participate in
various
initiatives, raise
donations, and
make collective
decisions.
Following the
concept of
DAOs,
IreneDAO has
been managed
by community
members and
has a treasury
generated by
NFT sales. After
an impressive
debut on
January 17 2022
and a starting
price of around 3
Ether, her NFTs
were quick to
drop in price,
hitting 0.7 Ether.
The current
average price of
IreneDAO NFTs
is 0.06 ETH on
OpenSea. Zhao
left IreneDAO
soon to focus on
her other project,
the social
network SO-
COL, as
mentioned on
social media.
Although
IreneDAO
continues to
operate, the
trading volume
of the NFTs
reveals that
interest in the
project isn’t high.
SO-COL (social
collectables) is a
Web3 social
platform
designed for
creators to mint
NFTs and
connect with
fans. The
platform was
founded by Irene
and friends in
2021 as a
blockchain-
based
alternative to
social networks
like OnlyFans,
Discord, and
Twitch,
according to the
influencer’s
LinkedIn
account. SO-
COL was
created before
IreneDAO but
became widely
known later
when it began
attracting
investment.
According to the
founders,
IreneDAO was
initiated as a
proof of concept
to test the social
media platform.
From 2022 to
2023, SO-COL
raised $6.25
million from
companies
including
Animoca
Brands, DWF
Labs, and
Blockchain
Capital.

The investment
from DWF Labs
comes with a
catch though. In
February 2023,
SO-COL
announced
receiving a $1.5
million
investment from
DWF in a
funding round.
However, data
from the
analytics
platform Nansen
showed that
DWF’s crypto
wallet received
3.3 million SIMP
tokens between
March 6 and
March 24. This
suggests that
the investment
involved a token-
selling deal
between the
companies,
implying that it
was kept secret
from other
investors. SO-
COL’s SIMP
token fell sharply
after its launch.
Currently, SIMP
trades at around
$0.00093, down
                   Irene Zhao:
97.3% from its
                   Model’s Career
all-time high of
                   in Crypto and
$0.08, based on
                   Public
data from
                   Controversies
CoinMarketCap.
With over
216,000
followers on X
and launching
new projects,
Irene Zhao
surely has some
impact on the
crypto industry.
Having a
bachelor’s
degree in
communication
and new media,
Irene worked as
a commodity
broker from 2017
to 2021. At the
same time, she’s
been an
Instagram model
and shifted to
crypto in 2022
finding it difficult
to get people’s
trust, as seen
from the post by
ZachXBT we
mentioned
earlier. Based
on social media
comments and
discussions,
there are two
camps of
opinions: one
supports Irene,
and the other is
suspicious of her
activity because
of previous
failures.

As a whole, it’s a
bit confusing to
figure out if Irene
Zhao is
someone
looking for quick
gains or
launching user-
focused projects.
The anticipated
launch of the
ASIAN MOM
memecoin will
perhaps provide
some answers.
In any case, be
aware that the
number of
someone’s
followers and the
amount of raised
investments
don’t guarantee
a project’s
fairness and
success. Stay
informed and do
your own
research before
making an           Who Is Irene
